\begin{abstract}
With the growth and evolution of cloud applications, more and more architectures use hybrid clouds to use optimally virtual resources regarding pricing policies and performance. This process led to the creation of management platforms as well as abstract libraries. At the moment, many cloud management platforms(in a further CMP or middlewares) try to cover this requirement. With the growth of such solutions, there is a need for a test environment that could automatically compare existing platforms and help in choosing the most optimal one. This paper focused on the creation of the concept and an actual piece of extendable software which would make experiments repeatable and reusable by other researchers and standardise output and evaluation criteria.
